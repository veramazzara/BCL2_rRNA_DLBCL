# BCL2 rRNA DLBCL (Rossi A et al.)

This is a separate repository from our manuscript **"Impaired rRNA synthesis contributes to BCL-2 induced chemoresistance in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma"** by A. Rossi et al, collecting code we used to process and analyzed RNAseq data in our manuscript (and for making figures).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main folder, bulk_rnaseq, is subdivided in:

pipeline: contains the custom pipeline of RNA-seq 
analysis: contains the scripts of the downstream analysis and the code to produce the figures asssociated to the RNA-seq data
To run the downstreamn analysis we used mainly R scripts and some Jupyter notebooks. If you want to convert the scripts and run them as notebook using Jupyter, please see Jupytext

The RNA-seq data (raw data) generated during this study are available on request fro the corresponding author: enrico.derenzini@ieo.it.
